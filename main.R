# TODO: models still give a bit too different results, find ways for testing
# TODO documentation is still inconsistent, needs more work


# TODO: the procedure might break when running it for 3700 plots
# run_soc_models_oneplot() should drop most results and keep only annual means

# TODO Start drafting the Bayesian sampling and test
# TODO: be very careful with the implementation, the input mapping takes time to run, might be cutting some execution time there?
